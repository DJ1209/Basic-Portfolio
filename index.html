                                        about web developing and I loved it. After that I never got chance to learn in detail about it so very 
                                        excited for this course.

                                        Little bit about my hobbies – I love dancing. I used to teach dancing to school kids back in India which I 
                                        miss the most besides Pani-puri (Indian Street Food). I try to stay fit and healthy, but it doesn’t work 
                                        always as I am very foody. I spend good amount of time in my kitchen trying new recipes.
